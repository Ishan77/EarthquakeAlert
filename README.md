# EarthquakeAlert
This is a cool app that runs on Qypthon on Android and gives earthquake alert. In the main file the users have to set the earhquake threshold to see all the earthquake of that threshold. Also you have to set the phone number list. The program automatically sends message to people incase of an earthquake that has crossed the threshold.
